# DCSS
A JS Library that makes debugging css easier

##### Functionality
The library brings your console into your webpage. It creates a temporary html wrapper that follows your cursor, so you can preview all your logs as you navigate across the webpage.

##### Usage
Download the minified version of the library from the dist folder named **dcss.min.js** and include it in your HTML file.

```html
<script src="js/dcss.min.js"></script>
```
Now to initiate dcss, create an instance of the class dcss as follows

```javascript
var dcss = new DCSS();
```
